    "The [Cabinet](http://www.parl.gc.ca/parliamentarians/en/ministries) in the current Canadian Parliament is the first Cabinet in Canadian history to be composed of an equal number of men and women. However, women are still underrepresented in Parliament. In 2016, only 26% of the House of Commons is represented by women (see the [Parliament of Canada](http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Lists/Occupation.aspx?Menu=PARL-HOC&Section=03d93c58-f843-49b3-9653-84275c23f3fb&Parliament=b67c82bf-0106-42e5-9be1-46ecb5feaf60&Name=&Party=&Province=&Gender=F&CurrentParliamentarian=False&Occupation=&OccupationType=)).\n",

    "1. Who was the first woman elected to the House of Commons?\n",
    "2. How many women (in total and as a percentage) were elected to the House of Commons in each Parliament?\n",

    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In 1921, Agnes Macphail was the first woman elected to the House of Commons.\n",
    "2. It was not for another 50 years that number of elected women started to increase: Grace Macinnis was still the only woman elected in 1968. The percentage of the House of Commons represented by women exceeded 10% for the first time in 1984 and the maximum was 26% in the 42nd Parliament elected in 2015.\n",
    "3. The percentage of the House of Commons represented by women increased by +0.58%/year from 1968-2015.\n",
    "4. At this rate, **it will take approximately 41 years to achieve gender balance in the House of Commons (in the year 2056).** There is a need to promote the success of women in Canadian Federal Politics to achieve gender balance much sooner than this projection.\n",
